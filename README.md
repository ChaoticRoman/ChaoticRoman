Hello,

I hold a degree in physics with a specialization in scientific computing and computer-controlled experimentation. Since embarking on my professional journey in 2009, I have adopted Python as my primary programming language. Additionally, C and C++ play a pivotal role in my work, especially within the domain of embedded systems, where my expertise with these languages is particularly pronounced.

My professional background encompasses roles in scientific computing at the Czech Academy of Sciences, specifically within the Astrophysical Institute and the Institute of Atmospheric Physics. I have also contributed as a DevOps engineer at Red Hat and have undertaken projects across the medical, aerospace, and industrial sectors.

Presently, I am an independent engineer with a focus on artificial intelligence. I dedicate my time to training and mentoring fellow engineers and providing consultancy services to companies navigating complex challenges.
