Hi, there!

I studied physics, specializing in scientific computing and computer-controlled
experimentation, and I have been working in the field from 2009, with Python
as my language of choice from the beginning. My professional history includes
scientific computing at the Czech Academy of Sciences (Astrophysical Institute
and Institute of Atmospheric Physics), DevOps engineering at Red Hat,
and contracts in the medical, aerospace, and industrial fields. Currently,
I am an embedded software engineer at Siemens Advanta.
