Hi, there!

I have a physics degree with a focus on scientific computing and computer-controlled experimentation.
Since the start of my career in 2009, Python has been my primary programming language of choice.
C and C++ have been equally critical, particularly in the realm of embedded systems where these languages are first-class tools in my skill set.
My experience includes scientific computing at the Czech Academy of Sciences (Astrophysical Institute
and Institute of Atmospheric Physics), DevOps engineering at Red Hat, and projects in medical, aerospace, and industrial sectors.
Currently, I'm an embedded software engineer at Siemens Advanta.
