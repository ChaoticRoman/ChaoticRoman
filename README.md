**TLDR (250 characters limit often enforced):**

Former physicist turned software engineer. I have worked as a DevOps engineer, machine vision specialist, video streaming application developer, embedded engineer, and custom software developer. I am passionate about Linux, open-source and teaching.

**Longer version:**

Hello,

I hold a degree in physics with a specialization in scientific computing and computer-controlled experimentation. Since beginning my professional journey in 2009, I have adopted Python as my primary programming language. Additionally, C and C++ play an important role in my work, particularly in the development of embedded systems.

My professional background encompasses roles in scientific computing at the Czech Academy of Sciences, specifically within the Astrophysical Institute and the Institute of Atmospheric Physics. I have also contributed as a DevOps Engineer at Red Hat and have undertaken projects across the medical, aerospace, and industrial sectors.

Currently, I am an Embedded Linux Engineer working on Mobile Mapping Camera Systems.
